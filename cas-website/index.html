            <p id="info">Corpora Caelestia is a visualisation of satellites in geostationary(GEO) orbit that were launched over the past three years (2019-21). 
                It showcases the inequalities between the world's nations using satellites as an indicator of power and status.
                <br><br>
                Each satellite is procedurally generated based on factors like purpose, year of launch, etc. and mapped to its location in space using 
                actual satellite position data. The satellites connect to their respective owner country and launch site.
                <br><br>
                There are 7 launch sites and 14 countries who own satellites. This demonstrates the hierarchy of nations in the Space Race because 
                geostationary satellites are the hardest to launch due to being the highest distance from the earth's crust. Countries owning launch sites
                and satellites gives them monopoly over the communication they support and the data they collect.
                <br><br>
                Corpora Caelestia questions the need for a Space Race and the monetisation of outer space for furthering global inequality. This is a project
                by Apurv Rayate based on <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database">this dataset</a>.
